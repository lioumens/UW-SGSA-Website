## Mathematical Statistics

* [*Statistical Inference, Casella and Berger*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910206891502121). This book is written at a
  Masters level and is (in my opinion) one of the best books to begin learning
  graduate level statistics. The chapter contents are helpful, but most of the
  learning is from doing the problems. Read Ch. 1-7 straight through, then pick and choose.
* [*Mathematical Statistics, Jun Shao*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910903294602121). This is the book you will use for
  Stat709/710, written by our very own Professor Jun Shao. The book requires some working
  knowledge of measure theoretic probability. If you want to glance through it, nearly every PhD student in the department has a copy.
* [*Theory of Point Estimation, Lehmann and Casella*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9911032002902121). This book seems to be a
  popular reference for PhD level statistical theory. It's well written and
  covers many topics somewhat concisely. Much more expository than Professor Shao's book.
* [*Mathematical Statistics: Basic Ideas and Selected Topics, Bickel and
  Doksum*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999915339002121). Older classic book on statistical inference (also by our own Professor Doksum). This is probably the
  book that you will use if you take Stat610.

## Linear Models

* [*Applied Linear Statistical Models by Kutner, Nachtsheim, and Neter*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999993224902121) seems to be a silent favorite if you are new to linear regression. It's a big book, and fairly detailed. Also contains experimental design stuff. Suitable for students wishing to learn linear regression from outside of statistics as well.
* [*Linear Models in Statistics, Rencher and Schaalje*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910084565502121). If you're a graduate student new to regression, this is a good place to start. Develops a rigorous and step-by-step framework for classic linear regression. The book is used for parts of Stat849. Matrix theory in Ch. 2 is useful as a refresher.

## Experimental Design

* [*A First Course in Experimental Design, Oehlert*](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~gary/Book.html). Great introduction to experimental design. Extremely readable. Will benefit you to supplement this with other texts with more mathematical details/derivations. PDF download made available by author.
* [*Analysis of Messy Data, Milliken and Johnson*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910072994002121). This book seems to be a classic, and recommended by many professors. Although, I wouldn't recommend learning from it. I found it a little difficult to work through. Beware, there are quite a few errors in the book too, so find an errata.


## Bayesian Statistics

* [*Bayesian Data Analysis, Gelman, et al.*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910191568002121) This is THE classic for Bayesian statistics. Must have if you are planning on doing any Bayesian analysis.
* [*Bayesian Nonparametrics, Hjort, et al.*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910089493702121) "It's a classic."
* [*Statistical Rethinking, Richard McElreath*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9912140533102121). A much lauded introductory text that's more approachable than BDA3.

## Asymptotic Statistics

* [*Asymptotic Statistics, A.W. van der Waart*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910921735502121). Graduate level textbook. The chapters are mixed, some chapters require deep mathematical sophistication, and less statistical exposition, while other chapters are light on mathematic details but require strong familiarity with classic statistical results. Probably better as reference than reading straight through.

## Statistical Computing

* [*Computational Statistics, Givens and Hoeting*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9912217600102121). Longer exposition for  text for model-based approaches.
* [*Elements of Statistical Computing, Thisted*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999588883802121). Reads well for the classic methods. Highly recommended for Stat771. Used to be required.
* [*Numerical analysis for Statisticians, Lange*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999936725402121). Very complete, and concise. Concise to the point that the book is better used as a reference than learning material from for the first time.

## Statistical/Machine Learning

* [*Machine Learning, Mitchell*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999810531202121). Old standard on Machine Learning. Written concisely, but starts from the basic foundations. Great for the historical perspective of the field.
* [*Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Bishop*](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910032530902121). Covers the basics fairly thoroughly. Examples and narrative are straight-forward.
* [*The Elements of Statistical Learning, Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman*](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/). Excellent overview with sufficient detail. A fairly tool-focused book in my opinion. A quick glance through the TOC will give you an excellent idea of what you can get from this book. PDF download available by authors.

## Convex Optimization

* [*Convex Optimization, Boyd and Vandenberghe*](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/). This is it. Really clear explanations and wildly popular. Must read if doing any convex optimization. PDF download available by authors.

## Programming

* [*Advanced R, Wickham*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). Self explanatory. Deep dive into the machinery of R, absolutely necessary for serious programming in R or satisfying your curiousity of how the language really works. Available online by author.

* [*R for Data Science, Wickham*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). An introduction to R focused on efficient modeling workflows rather than details of the language

* [*R Packages for Data Science, Wickham*](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). The canonical reference on how to write an R package. Keep an eye out for second edition, currently being written in the open (online) by Jenny Bryan.

* [*Bioinformatics Data Skills, V. Buffalo*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do)
  and [resources](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files).
  Great to start learning bash / shell scripting, and git for version control
