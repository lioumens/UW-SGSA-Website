# Housing in Madison

Searching for housing can be a stressful time. Fortunately, the UW Law School has
a fairly complete, unofficial housing guide publically available on the web.
It's a great introduction to the apartment hunting process and the neighborhood
vibes around Madison.

* [An Introduction to the Madison
  neighborhoods](https://law.wisc.edu/admitted/neighborhoods.html) with some
  idea of what your surrounding amenities and daily commute will be like, along
  with some monthly rent estimates. One popular area left out of the guide is
  the Hilldale Shopping Area apartments; it is a very lively part of town with
  a nearby mall, Target, Whole Foods, and a convenient 20 minute bus commute to the Medical Sciences Building. This area to be popular amongst
  international students.
* [The Utterly Unofficial Housing Guide](https://law.wisc.edu/admitted/housingguide.html) has links to the most popular house aggregating search tools, a step through of the process and some advice from other graduate students.
