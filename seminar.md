# Student Seminar Schedule

This is the official schedule for the student seminar series. The student seminar series features the research work of current students. We aim to have a speaker about once every other week. Future iterations of the seminar will include topics such as internship experience and computing workshops, depending on interest. We hope to have food at each of the seminars depending on funding!

The series has a number of goals:
1. Provide opportunities for graduate students to practice presentations for upcoming conferences or group meetings and receive feedback from other graduate students in a more comfortable and informal environment
2. Serve to facilitate casual interactions with other students with similar research interests.
3. Keep students active and aware of peer research work.
4. Share notable internship and teaching experiences.
5. Make useful workshops for students.
