# Welcome!

We are the Statistics Graduate Student Association at UW-Madison. We founded in 2018 with the goal of coordinating the graduate student activities of the department. We currently coordinate the student seminar, the department happy hour at The Sett, and this website. We also hope to create a stronger community among the statistics department by focusing on development of our professional networks, training in modern statistical tools, and cultivation of research interests.

Here we've collected a number of resources we hope will be helpful for both current and new students here at UW-Madison, including information on coursework, career resources, and things to do around Madison.
