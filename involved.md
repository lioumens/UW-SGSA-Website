## Join Us!

<strong>We are actively recruiting for any students that would like to help organize events for the organization!</strong>

Whether you simply want your opinion heard during our open discussions, or create a new event in the department, we welcome your involvement.

We hold a general meeting once per academic semester that involves some general discussion about what we can improve in our statistics community on campus.

Let us know if you want to contribute to SGSA! 

*Please direct all questions, comments, and concerns to sgsa@stat.wisc.edu instead of contacting individuals regarding personal opinions and other issues.*
