## Master's Exam

The official information can be found at the [department website](https://stat.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/870/2020/08/Statistics-MS-Handbook-2020-2021.pdf).

Briefly, you are given two applied "consulting" projects from two clients and 1 full
week to write a reports for both cases. You will have 1 opportunity to meet
each of the clients to discuss any questions you might have about their data and their 
research questions. 

The reports are submitted, and an oral defense with a committee of ~4 professors is scheduled. During the oral defense, they will ask you some questions about your report and you must justify your decisions made.
They generally try to get the decisions out after the next faculty meeting.

#### Advice collected from previous students

*  Master's Exam Checklist (courtesy of Alex C.)
> These questions are intended to help you check your work ask you work on the master's exam and are not exhaustive. Many of these are also worth looking over to review for the oral exam.
> 
> Preliminary (Be sure to hit these before speaking with the client)
> * Do you understand the question?
> * Underline any terms or passages that you think are unclear and be ready to ask about them.
> * Do you know what every entry in the data set means? Is there anything surprising about the data set?
> * Check if there's anything you think might effect the measured outcome (time, position, interaction terms) and ask the client what they think the effect will be.
> 
> Data
> * Does the data need to be transformed?
> * Is there any data missing? Do some categories have more data than others?
> * Is there anything striking about how the data is distributed?
> 
> Graphs 
> * Check if the data could be better represented by adding colors / shapes / widths / splitting graphs
> * Does our graph help in understanding the scientific question? If not, do we need it?
> * Could we add a line of fit / loess curve?
> 
> Model
> * Have we included everything that makes sense in our model?
> * What assumptions are made for the model? Are they reasonable?
> * What are all the terms in the model? 
> 
> Analysis
> * Does the information we've taken from the model best answer the question? 
> * Did we get any results that were surprising? Does this mean we need to redo anything?

* Report Writing Skills and preparation while taking classes (Chelsea G.)
> * Start practicing LaTeX and ggplot (tidyverse) early when you are doing your assignments (i.e. homework for stat850). Practice typing them up and importing your figures. It’s easier to practice those skills over the first year and a half instead of in time pressured situations in which you need to generate a report such as during the Master’s Exam.
> 
> * Make sure to practice *precise* interpretations and with all the calculations you’re doing, double check that you can interpret your results consistently and appropriately. Ask “how would I use that"?
> 
> * While you are in class or have access to professors, always feel free to ask when the assumptions aren’t met, or you’re missing this data. Are these the questions that scientists typically have about this data?
> 
> * When you’re asked on an assignment to analyze something in a certain way, ask yourself if there are other ways to answer this question. For example, we can talk about the mean response, or we can talk about the % mean response over a certain threshold.

* Client Meeting & Time Management (Michael L.)
> * Spend as much time as possible looking/working with the dataset before you meet with the clients. You will only have ~15 minutes to meet with the client, so the more time you spend with the datasets, the more directed your questions can be, and the more efficient use of your time. You don't want to be left in the situation in which later you try an analysis but realize you come up with some counterintuitive result that can't be clarified with the client.
> 
> * Since you're working with real client data here, expect to do at least a little data cleaning. In our case, there was ~4-5 hours of data cleaning before any sort of meaningful analysis!
> 
> * Expect ~50 hours of work on the lower end, and 100+ hours on the upper end to do well! Cleaning, exploration, analysis, writing, graphics, formatting... it's a lot of work!

### Practice Materials

The statistics office has record of all past qualifying exams for the department all the way back to the mid 1900s, but will not allow you to take photocopies of the exams. You will surely not run out of 
practice problems...
