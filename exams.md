Master's Exam Checklist (courtesy of Alex C.)
> These questions are intended to help you check your work ask you work on the master's exam and are not exhaustive. Many of these are also worth looking over to review for the oral exam.

> * Do you understand the question?
> * Underline any terms or passages that you think are unclear and be ready to ask about them.
> * Do you know what every entry in the data set means? Is there anything surprising about the data set?
> * Check if there's anything you think might effect the measured ourcome (time, position, interaction terms) and ask the client what they think the effect will be.
> 
> ##### Data
> * Does the data need to be transformed?
> * Is there any data missing? Do some categories have more data than others?
> * Is there anything striking about how the data is distributed?
> 
> ##### Graphs 
> * Check if the data could be better represented by adding colors / shapes / widths / splitting graphs
> * Does our graph help in understanding the scientific question? If not, do we need it?
> * Could we add a line of fit / loess curve?
> 
> ##### Model
> * Have we included everything that makes sense in our model?
> * What assumptions are made for the model? Are they reasonable?
> * What are all the terms in the model? 
>
