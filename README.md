# UW-Madison Statistics Graduate Student Association Website

This is the official repository for the SGSA website. If you are a graduate
student in statistics, please feel free to submit any issues and pull requests
to make this your own. Our goal is to make this a useful reference to current
graduate students in statistics, at UW but also other universities.

## Images

The images are from the [Wisconsin Photo
Library](https://uwmadison-photos.photoshelter.com/index). Images shown on the
website are in the `images` directory.

## How the website was made

The website was made with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). The
documentation here is much more complete for anything regarding this website.

#### Quick Orientation

The entry point for the homepage is `aboutus.md`. The parameter options are in
`index.html` (sidebar, homepage, etc.). Each page has its own `.md` file,
including the coverpage and sidebar (which is actually written in yaml style).
The `readme.md` is this document you are reading now.

Finally, there is a `custom.css` file to make a few cosmetic changes to the
website look if you feel you need it.

To preview the site locally, install docsify, and run `docsify serve`.

## Hosting

Hosting is done on the stat servers. If there's anything wrong, you should 
contact the IT department. If you're the new technology chair, you'll also
have to talk to them to get edit permissions on the production version of 
the website.
