# UW-Madison Statistics Graduate Student Association Website

This is the official repository for the SGSA website. If you are a graduate
student in statistics, please feel free to submit any issues and pull requests
to make this your own. Our goal is to make this a useful reference to current
graduate students in statistics, at UW but also other universities.

## Images

The images are from the [Wisconsin Photo
Library](https://uwmadison-photos.photoshelter.com/index). Images shown on the
website are in the `images` directory.

## How the website was made

The website was made with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). The
documentation here is much more complete for anything regarding this website.

#### Quick Orientation

The entry point for the homepage is `aboutus.md`. The parameter options are in
`index.html` (sidebar, homepage, etc.). Each page has its own `.md` file,
including the coverpage and sidebar (which is actually written in yaml style).
The `readme.md` is this document you are reading now.

Finally, there is a `custom.css` file to make a few cosmetic changes to the
website look if you feel you need it.

To preview the site locally, install docsify, and run `docsify serve`.

## Hosting

If there's anything wrong on the hosting end, you should contact Mike in IT.
